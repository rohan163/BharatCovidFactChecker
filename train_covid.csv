70,Are there roadblocks in India's fight against the deadly Covid-19,"Has the Tamil Nadu chief secretary let the cat out of the bag? While briefing the media in Chennai on Saturday, after the conclusion of the state cabinet meeting, Tamil Nadu Chief Secretary K Shanmugam said there is a delay in receiving the rapid antibody test kits Tamil Nadu had ordered because the consignment, meant for India, had been diverted to the United States by China.The bureaucrat informed that the state had placed an order of a total of 4 lakh test kits with the Centre, of which 1 lakh was expected from China. Shanmugam said though the production of rapid antibody test kits was limited to China, it had sent one consignment to the USA.This could possibly explain the constant delay in India receiving its order of 5 lakh rapid antibody test kits that it had placed with a Chinese firm on March 28.At least four deadlines for delivery have been missed so far, adding to India's wait for conducting more tests to detect the spread of Covid-19 among its citizens.Rapid antibody tests are quicker and inexpensive alternative to the standard RT-PCR tests being conducted currently in the country.The advisory to start rapid antibody-based blood tests for Covid-19 was issued by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on April 4. It authorised for the tests to be conducted in areas reporting clusters (containment zone) and in large migration gatherings/evacuee centres.But the first order for the rapid antibody test kits was placed on March 28, and since then deadlines have only come and gone.Dr Raman Gangakhedkar, Head of Epidemiology at ICMR, told the media on Saturday, ""We are yet to receive the rapid antibody test kits. The supplier has said it will take another 2-3 days.""Due to the delay in the arrival of the first batch of test kits, ICMR is unable to ramp up the order to at least 50 lakh, as has been already internally approved.In fact, as opposed to its initial requirement of 10 lakh test kits, for which it had invited Indian bidders on March 25, it was compelled to revise the order down to 5 lakh after no bidder came forward.This delay is only setting back India in its quest to test more people for coronavirus, which is the only way to accurately determine the size of the Covid-19 outbreak in the country and subsequently curtail it.In fact, on Saturday, in the meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi over a videoconference, several chief ministers reiterated their demands for rapid antibody test kits for their respective states.Even in the case of personal protective equipment (PPE) or specialised safety gear for doctors and medical practitioners at the forefront of the battle against Covid-19, delays by the government in placing orders with the 39 domestic manufacturers identified for production, could have placed at risk thousands of healthcare professionals.Reports indicate that some of the orders were placed just as India was going into its three-week nationwide lockdown on March 25. With the lockdown in place, manufacture and supply of PPEs may have disrupted.However, the government has tried to allay fears. Recently, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare Joint Secretary Lav Aggarwal told the media that an order of 1.7 crore PPEs have been placed and supplies have begun. He added that 49,000 ventilators have also been ordered.",REAL,,
71,How the 21-day lockdown can be a turning point for India,"As the world struggles with the coronavirus pandemic, the country coming in for maximum negative coverage — barring China — is perhaps India.However, from all accounts, the advanced nations of the West are faring no better than the lesser-accomplished ones. There are disconcerting reports, both from the USA and the UK, of doctors considering ""universal do-not-resuscitate order"" for Covid-19 patients. In Italy, one hears the medical system is so overwhelmed with a shortage of ICU facilities and critical equipment as ventilators, that they are not able to treat all patients. The biggest casualty being senior citizens, who are also the most vulnerable to contracting the infection.The criticism about India is, not unexpectedly, largely from domestic quarters. With a slight difference that many of the voices — though of Indian origin — are emanating across the pay-walls of international media. India has received flak for an allegedly unplanned countrywide lockdown throwing millions of poor migrant workers to fend for themselves. Government has been held responsible for a shortage of PPEs, masks and testing kits. Low reported numbers of Covid-19 positive cases was attributed to inadequate testing. Claims of community transmission held in check have been debunked, questioning the sanctity of data. Entirely inappropriate parallels have been drawn with South Korea and Singapore, which are both smaller in size, with far higher per capita GDP and a more disciplined population to boot. It is another matter that these countries have slipped back into regression on the Covid-19 recovery graph.

Based on the samples collected, we can say that the infection rate is not high, although it is dynamic,” Lav Agarwal, joint secretary in the health ministry, said even as he emphasised the need for social distancing.Referring to the ICMR study that shows 40% of SARI cases had not reported travel or contact history, Agrawal said the conclusions cannot be inferred as community transmission because the tests were conducted in areas where there were Covid-19 cases and people are often not able to recall exact events. “This needs further investigation,” he said.Government experts said even a higher incidence of the disease in an area or clusters does not necessarily add up to community transmission. Several clusters in an area or a city with rapidly multiplying cases and transmission between them amount to community transmission at stage 3.",REAL,,

Screening of those entering Punjab will be done at all state and district border entry points, as well as railway stations and airports. Those found symptomatic would be sent into institutional quarantine, while, the others would have to undergo mandatory 2-week home quarantine, the chief minister said during his Facebook live program `#AskCaptain'.

Rapid testing teams will keep a check on the home quarantined people, while those found symptomatic would have to undergo thorough testing in hospitals and isolation centres, said Captain Amarinder, making it clear that his government would not rely on any certificates of testing from any part of the country or the world.

He cited Punjab's experience with those who came from Maharashtra and Rajasthan, as well as the more recent case of Dubai, wherein Punjabis returnees had tested positive despite carrying medical certificates showing them to be negative.

It may be recalled that those returning to India via special international flights are already required to undergo institutional quarantine, as per the Central government's guidelines.

With a large number of Punjabis coming home, and more and more investors also showing keenness to resume business in the state, the chief minister underlined the need for strict caution, asserting that ""We will not let the pandemic spread further in Punjab, which has so far managed to keep the situation under excellent control"".Responding to a question, the chief minister said that there is a likelihood of infections entering the state through Punjabis returning from other countries and states, but, Punjab is taking no chances and has made elaborate arrangements for their testing and quarantine.

84,Covid-19 vaccine development at early stage in India; breakthrough unlikely within a year: Experts,"As Indian firms scramble to develop a vaccine for coronavirus, experts feel that research in the country is still at a nascent stage and any concrete breakthrough is not likely within a year.

The Indian government and private firms have stepped up efforts to develop a vaccine to halt the spread of Covid-19 which has claimed over 3,700 lives with more than 1,25,000 cases in the country.

PM CARES Fund Trust has decided to allocate Rs 100 crore for support to coronavirus vaccine development efforts.

Referring to a vaccine to fight the virus, a PMO statement had said that it is the most pressing need and Indian academia, start-ups and industry have come together in cutting-edge vaccine design and development.

The Department of Biotechnology has been made a central coordination agency to identify pathways for vaccine development.

Naming the Indian firms working on vaccines for Covid-19, Gagandeep Kang, executive director of the Translational Health Science and Technology Institute, Faridabad, had said last month that while Zydus Cadila is working on two vaccines, Serum Institute, Biological E, Bharat Biotech, Indian Immunologicals, and Mynvax are developing one vaccine each.

The WHO has listed Serum Institute of India, Zydus Cadila, Indian Immunologicals Limited and Bharat Biotech from India among the firms involved in developing a vaccine.

Leading virologist Shahid Jameel said India's vaccine manufacturing capacity is quite remarkable and at least three Indian companies - Serum Institute, Bharat Biotech and Biologicals E are at the forefont, working with international partners to manufacture a vaccine for Covid-19.""Research on a Covid-19 vaccine in India is at a very early stage of development and any candidates are likely to reach animal trials only by the end of the year,"" he told PTI.

However, Indian vaccine companies have a lot of capacity and expertise, and are likely to play a significant role in bringing new Covid-19 vaccines to the market.

This experience is important for institutions, industry and regulators to work together, and prepare for the future, said Jameel, a Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize winner for Science and Technology and the current Chief Executive Officer of Wellcome Trust/Department of Biotechnology's India Alliance.

CSIR-Centre for Cellular & Molecular Biology (CCMB) Director Rakesh Mishra said, ""From what we know, we are not at an advanced stage of vaccine development at the moment.""

""There are lots of ideas and companies initiating vaccine development process but there is nothing on trial in terms of vaccine candidates,"" he told PTI.

There are many efforts going on with different approaches like somebody wants to use the whole virus or a particular protein so there are multiple processes being deployed, he said.

""Many Indian companies are collaborating with foreign institutions.Other countries are at much advanced stage than us. Some are going into third stage trials. There is no company testing vaccine in India yet and they are in the pre-clinical stage of preparation,"" he said.

India is quite behind because of a number of reasons like the coronavirus came to India two-three months later so ""we did not have the (inactivated) virus to test or even the urgency"", Mishra said, adding that the Chinese and US are quite ahead in the vaccine development.

""If a comparison has to be made we are well behind international efforts,"" he said.

The novel coronavirus strain was isolated and characterised at the Indian Council of Medical Research's National Institute of Virology, Pune, and the vaccine candidate has been transferred to Bharat Biotech International Limited (BBIL) to develop a fully indigenous vaccine for Covid-19.

""Once the vaccine is ready it will go for animal trials to be followed by human clinical trials to assess its safety and efficacy which will take at least one year,"" a senior ICMR official told PTI.

The BBIL is working towards developing killed virus vaccine which usually provides good immunogenicity, the official said, adding that by entering the body it will create antibody against the infection.

The polio drops which are given to children have live attenuated virus, while the polio injection contains killed virus, the official said explaining the different approaches used in developing a vaccine.

""The BBIL is continuously working in this direction and as soon as they get the right formulation they will move towards animal challenge studies followed by human clinical trials,"" the official said.

Kang, in a webinar held by India Alliance, said there are two separate aspects that relates to vaccines of COVID-19, one is to use existing products and the second is to see if new vaccines can be made.""In terms of projects to develop vaccines there are around 90 plus projects around the world that have initiated to develop new vaccines which use different kinds of technologies. Some are using old technologies like make an inactivated virus and spike protein and other using new technologies that allow you to respond rapidly like using messenger RNA vaccines,"" Kang said.

Every new technology is being applied for making COVID-19 vacines, he said.

The Indian firms along with their foreign collaborators are racing against time to develop a vaccine against COVID-19 with over 52 lakh cases and over 3.35 lakh fatalities across the globe.",REAL,,

Balakrishnan's travel service has over 70 cars and he employs more than 50 permanent drivers. But due the Covid-19 pandemic and the nationwide lockdown, the situation is grim. He says only six of his 70 cars have been hired in the past two months.

He provides lodging for his drivers who are from other districts in the state. During the lockdown too, he has continued to provide them essentials but says he is struggling to do so. About 15 of his drivers from other districts are in Chennai, while 15 have returned to the native places.

88,Over 100 districts report 100 per cent growth in Covid-19 cases in seven days,"Nearly 16 per cent districts in India have reported more than 100 per cent rise in coronavirus cases in seven days, half of them in green zones, the India Today Data Intelligence Unit (DIU) has found after analysing 717 districts till May 20. Experts and health authorities have said that migrants, who returned from cities such as Mumbai and Delhi to their native districts, are behind the spike in these areas.

Data shows Dungarpur district in Rajasthan recorded more than 1,500 per cent rise in Covid-19 cases in seven days. Similarly, Jamui district in Bihar witnessed a spike of 1,300 per cent, followed by Ballia and Ambedkar Nagar districts in Uttar Pradesh, which reported 1,100 per cent rise in seven days. Then come Uttar Dinajpur district in West Bengal (900 per cent) and Cuttack in Odisha (750 per cent).

In absolute terms, the number of cases may not be as big, but the growth rate in these emerging clusters has created a new challenge for local authorities. For example, Jamui and Supaul districts in Bihar reported 14 and 26 cases respectively in seven days, but in percentage terms, they have reported a growth rate of above 100 per cent.

Out of the total 112 high-risk districts, one-fourth are in Uttar Pradesh (27), followed by Madhya Pradesh (11), Odisha (10) and Bihar (9). Of the 54 green zone districts with the sharpest spike in cases, 14 are from Uttar Pradesh, seven from Odisha and six from Assam.In the first week of May, the ministry of health and family welfare explained the green zone classification, saying these are districts that have either recorded zero confirmed cases or no confirmed cases in the last 21 days.Some 53 districts in the yellow category have also reported above 100 per cent growth in coronavirus cases. These include 12 districts in Uttar Pradesh, seven in Bihar and five in Madhya Pradesh.

Five districts that the government classified as red zones also witnessed more than 100 per cent growth in cases. These are Khandwa and Gwalior districts in Madhya Pradesh, Bhadrak in Odisha, Malda in West Bengal and Rampur in Uttar Pradesh.DIU has also found that a total of 303 districts in India have witnessed up to 99 per cent growth in cases.

Nearly 136 districts have reported zero per cent growth in coronavirus cases in seven days as of May 20, data shows. These hopeful trends are coming from Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, Delhi, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh.

Migrant labourers are one of the reasons for the spike in these districts. A recent study by the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS), Mumbai, reveals that ""the major increase in the value of effective reproduction number was seen in the states of Bihar, Odisha, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh after May 9 due to increasing numbers of migrant workers returning to their home"".

States are conducting tests of maximum migrant returnees. Bihar has tested 8,337 people who had come from outside as of May 18, and found 651 as positive. The Uttar Pradesh health department said a total of 1,041 migrants who returned have tested positive for Covid-19 as of May 20.

""A large number of infections are being observed in migrant workers returning to the state. So it's very important for the village and mohalla monitoring committees to control the infection. They should ensure home quarantine for those coming from outside,"" Uttar Pradesh principal secretary (health) Amit Mohan Prasad said.

89,WHO advises against use of hydroxychloroquine even as ICMR approves,"he World Health Organization (WHO) has advised against the use of the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, saying it found no evidence, in randomised clinical trials, of drug's effectiveness for coronavirus treatment.

Speaking to India Today TV on Friday, the WHO Executive Director Michael J Ryan said, ""At present, there is no evidence from a randomised control trial of the effectiveness of HCQ in the treatment of prophylaxis against Covid-19"".

Michael Ryan pointed out that the drug has been used under randomized trials to study its effectiveness but should only be given in clinical settings under clinical supervision considering its side effects.

This comes on a day when the ICMR released an advisory backing the usage of HCQ as a preventive treatment against the novel coronavirus even outside clinical settings.

Quoting one of the three studies done in India, the ICMR said, ""Amongst healthcare workers involved in Covid-19 care, those on HCQ prophylaxis were less likely to develop SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared to those who were not on it.""

The new advisory recommended the use of hydroxychloroquine as a preventive medication for asymptomatic healthcare workers working in non-Covid-19 hospitals, frontline staff on surveillance duty in containment zones, and paramilitary/police personnel involved in coronavirus infection-related activities.

NEW STUDY

Meanwhile, The Lancet, a premier medical journal, published a large observational study on 14,888 coronavirus patients. It found that those being treated with HCQ and chloroquine are at a higher risk of death and irregular heart rhythms.

The researchers from Harvard Medical school, University Hospital Zurich and the University of Utah said, ""We were unable to confirm a benefit of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine when used alone or with a macrolide [azithromycin or clarithromycin], on in-hospital outcomes for Covid-19.""The researchers further claim that their ""large-scale, international, REAL-world analysis supports the absence of a clinical benefit of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine and points to potential harm in hospitalised patients with Covid-19.""

The study has drawn sharp reactions from independent experts.

Prof Stephen Evans, Professor of Pharmacoepidemiology, The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said, ""A definitive answer still awaits the results of the randomized trials, but it is clear that the drugs should not be given for the treatment of Covid-19 other than in the context of a randomised trial"".

Some experts also pointed out the limitations of the Lancet study. Prof Babak Javid, Principal Investigator, Tsinghua University School of Medicine, Beijing, and Consultant in Infectious Diseases at Cambridge University Hospitals, said, ""This was a retrospective analysis, not a prospective randomised controlled trial. Therefore, one cannot formally state that HCQ or CQ is not associated with benefit, but it certainly casts a great deal of doubt"".",REAL,,
90,"Lockdown reduced intensity of Covid-19 spread by more than 60%, shows study","Despite rising cases of coronavirus in India, the lockdown has been largely successful in containing the intensity of the spread, shows a study by the University of Michigan in the United States. In fact, the intensity of the spread has been reduced to almost a third of what it was prior to the lockdown.

India went into a more relaxed Lockdown 4.0 after 54 days of strict confinement. The onus of opening up has been put on states, many of which are gradually resuming non-essential services. Incidentally, India went under lockdown on March 25 when it had 500 cases, and started easing restrictions from May 18, when the Covid-19 tally crossed 100,000.

India recorded the highest single-day spike on May 22, recording more than 6,000 new cases, taking the total count to over 1.18 lakh, with almost 3,600 deaths and 49,000 recoveries. Since May 7, India has been recording more than 3,000 new cases every day, for which its decision to ease restrictions has come under criticism.

However, an analysis of the reproductive rate (R0) of the virus proves otherwise. The R0 tells us how many persons can be infected by a carrier. For example, an R0 of 2 means one person can infect two people on an average. An R0 below 1 would mean that every new infection is unable to infect even one person and the disease will eventually die out. This is the desirable number.

How lockdown helped

India Today Data Intelligence Unit (DIU) accessed figures of the reproduction rate 'R' of a virus - similar to R0 - calculated by the COV-IND-19 Study Group, School of Public Health, University of Michigan. We will use R0 for future reference in the article.The study found that on March 24, a day before India went under lockdown, R0 was 3.36, which means one infected person was infecting more than three non-infected persons. By the end of Lockdown 1.0, i.e. April 14, it came down to 1.71. On May 3, when Lockdown 2.0 ended, it reduced to 1.46, and on May 16, it further dipped to 1.27. This means the lockdown brought down the reproductive rate of the virus by almost three times.

Another study by the ministry of statistics and programme implementation and Indian Statistical Institute has found that 20 lakh cases and 54,000 deaths have been averted due to the lockdown. In other words, these many cases and deaths would have been added to India's tally had the R0 remained what it was before lockdown.

But the R0 is still above 1, which means the virus is still contagious. So what should be India's next move? Bhramar Mukherjee, professor of epidemiology at the School of Public Health, University of Michigan, believes that the 'triple-T' approach should be the way ahead for India.

""The target will be to get R0 closer to unity. The 'triple-T' principle of 'Test, Trace and Treat' will have to be optimised with intelligent strategy of symptom tracking, random testing and targeted testing. We may not be able to do 40 million tests in the next two weeks but we can create simple record-keeping for symptoms and contact diaries. Community engagement and protecting the most vulnerable from both economic and public health point of view will be the key,"" Professor Mukherjee said.State-wise data shows most Indian states have an R0 above 1. The data is further segregated into four parts - red states, where R0 is above 2; green states, where R0 is below 1; states with R0 above the national average of 1.27; and states with R0 below the national average.

Among the red states, Odisha had the highest R0 of 3. Odisha is followed by Tripura (2.4), Telangana (2.34) and Bihar (2.24). Punjab had the lowest R0 of 0.5, followed by Andhra Pradesh (0.91) and Haryana (0.94). The varied range of Covid-19 transmission could be attributed to the fact that the virus entered different states at different points of time.""The state-level variation seen in these plots suggests that different places are dealing with varying transmission rates at different times (which is not captured by the relatively stable R estimate at the national level) requiring tailored attention and response,"" the methodological note sent by the researchers said.

But with more than 1,000 cases, are Haryana, Andhra Pradesh and Punjab REALly free from the scourge of coronavirus? According to Professor Mukherjee, these states need to exhibit this trend for at least two weeks.Data shows that as of May 16, the seven-day average R0 in big states such as Karnataka (1.6), Madhya Pradesh (1.5), Tamil Nadu (1.49), Kerala (1.45) and Maharashtra (1.34) was higher than the national average of 1.27.Even with a high number of cases, Delhi (1.21), Gujarat (1.1) and Uttar Pradesh (1.01) still had a lower R0 than the national average. So did West Bengal, Chhattisgarh and Jammu and Kashmir.Professor Mukherjee believes that states with higher R0 ""need to keep an eye on hotspots and incentivise testing and quarantine"". ""Governments cannot hide data to maintain public image and the public cannot hide symptoms or exposure due to the fear of losing wages or being quarantined,"" she said.

""Public has an important role to play in public health. States need to buy-in from the affected communities and have a partnership approach. To me, Kerala has been a role model in this effort and an exemplar of how to fight the virus in a low-resource setting in a humane and efficient way,"" she added.

Can India continue in lockdown?

States have witnessed substantial economic loss due to the pandemic and the lockdown. Major states recorded a loss of revenue worth Rs 97,000 crore in April.

Thus, policy makers need to reach an equilibrium where the spread of coronavirus is controlled without taking a toll on the economy. Professor Mukherjee believes that ""eternal and perpetual lockdowns are not feasible for any nation"".

She further adds, ""We have seen this in other countries that have reopened. We have to be prepared for an uptick after the country reopens and have quarantine and isolation measures in place, and the healthcare system prepared. As you can see the reduction in R0 has been very gradual with the most recent phase of lockdown nationwide.""

Note on methodology

The R data analysis was done by Professor Bhramar Mukherjee and her students Xuelin Gu and Maxwell Salvatore. They termed the reproductive number as 'R' which is similar to the concept of R0. However, R0 is a constant that is inherent to the pathogen and not time-variant or impacted by interventions (such as social distancing or lockdown).They used the ""parametric_SI"" estimation method and a 5-day window, described by Cori et al., (""estimate_R"" function, which was used to describe the progression of the outbreak in Wuhan). They also use a gamma distribution with mean = 7.0 days and a standard deviation of 4.5 days, based on research by Wu et al. (2020), for the generation time (a distribution of the onset of disease used in the time-dependent estimation method to estimate R).",REAL,,
91,Oxford coronavirus vaccine: Phase II and III human trials announced,"Scientists at the University of Oxford began recruiting candidates on Friday for Phases II and III of human clinical trials of their coronavirus vaccine.

A statement released by the group said the first phase of human trials had seen the participation of 1,000 healthy adult individuals. For Phase II trials, the university is seeking 10,260 candidates, including senior citizens between 56-70 years of age and children of ages 5-12. In Phase III, the vaccine will be tested on a larger population.

Sarah Gilbert, professor of vaccinology at the Jenner Institute and lead researcher, said the vaccine trial team ""have been working hard on assessing the safety and immunogenicity of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 [the name of the vaccine], and are preparing to assess vaccine efficacy"".

""We have had a lot of interest already from people over the age of 55 years who were not eligible to take part in the Phase I study, and we will now be able to include older age groups to continue the vaccine assessment.""

Professor Andrew Pollard, head of the Oxford Vaccine Group, said, ""The clinical studies are progressing very well and we are now initiating studies to evaluate how well the vaccine induces immune responses in older adults, and to test whether it can provide protection in the wider population.""

CONTROL VACCINE

Participants in both upcoming phases will be randomised to receive one or two doses of either the coronavirus vaccine or a control vaccine: MenACWY, which is usually given to teenagers for protection against meningitis.

The participants won't know if they received the coronavirus vaccine or the control vaccine unless the trials are complete.The researchers say it is critical for this study ""that participants remain blinded to whether or not they have received the vaccine, as this could affect their health behaviour in the community following vaccination, and may lead to a bias in the results of the study.""

UK-based biopharmaceuticals company AstraZeneca says it has entered into an agreement with the Oxford group to manufacture 400 million doses of the vaccine by September.

THE ROAD AHEAD

The trial will assess how well people across a broad range of ages could be protected from the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus by the new vaccine.

Scientists expect to use this vaccine to make the human body recognise and develop an immune response that will help stop the coronavirus from entering human cells and prevent infection.

Some participants get an e-diary to record symptoms after receiving the vaccine.

A weekly survey will also be done to check any household exposure to the virus.

Follow-up testing for both the coronavirus and antibodies will be done.

The researchers will then compare the results of the two groups, but it's necessary for a small number of participants to develop Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus.

""How quickly we reach the numbers required will depend on the levels of virus transmission in the community. If transmission remains high, we may get enough data in a couple of months to see if the vaccine works. But if transmission levels drop, this could take up to six months."" the researchers said.

For this purpose, those with a higher chance of being exposed to the virus -- such as health workers and other essential service providers -- are given priority in these trials.

The results, once available, will be reviewed by neutral experts as well has regulatory bodies before a commercial licence is granted.

If the trial fails, the researchers say, they will review progress and examine alternative approaches -- such as using different numbers of doses -- and could potentially stop the programme.",REAL,,
